How to create a dynamic form with widok
=======================================

Not sure how to create a dynamic form with widok, and not sure if the *dynamic* approach proper?

how to run
----------

1. git clone
2. `sbt fastOptJS`
3. `open application.html`

Then click on the `+ member` button, but nothing happens. What I want is to show the popup form.
